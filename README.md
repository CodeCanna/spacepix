# Spacepix

## Welcome!
Hello and welcome to the Spacepix repository.  Spacepix is educational software that allows the user to explore the NASA API and it's data from a desktop application written in Rust and built on the [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) crate.

## Building and Running
Because Spacepix is written in Rust, it should run roughly the same on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

### To Build Spacepix
Run `gh repo clone CodeCanna/spacepix` or `git clone https://github.com/CodeCanna/spacepix.git`

Spacepix uses `Make` and `cargo` to build and run:
* `make all` Builds optimized for both Linux and Windows x64 targets (MAC to come) uses `--release`
* `make linux` Builds for both Linux and Windows optmized uses `--release`
* `make linuxdev` Builds for Linux x64 unoptmized
* `make windows` Builds for Windows x64 optimized uses `--release`
* `make windowsdev` Builds for Windows x64 unoptimized

### To Run Spacepix

#### Running with Cargo
If you just want to run Spacepix you can use `cargo run` or `cargo run --release` (optimizations)

#### Running with Make
You can run Spacepix with Make using `make run` or `make rrun` for optimizations using `--release`

# "Activating" Spacepix

### Obtaining an API key
Spacepix uses NASA's API to get it's data.  NASA requires that you [register here](https://api.nasa.gov/) to get a free API key.  This will allow you to use Spacepix with no limitations.

Once you get your API key, you can enter it in Spacepix by going to Settings->Set API Key.  For now you might have to restart Spacepix if it still doens't work but it should work after that.  There's an issue already open for this problem.

### Using NASA's demo API Key
NASA has a publically available API key for testing out the API.  You can go to Settings->Set API Key and type in `DEMO_KEY` instead of typing in an API key and Spacepix will use this public key, however the public key has limitations.

### DEMO_KEY Rate Limits

In documentation examples, the special DEMO_KEY api key is used. This API key can be used for initially exploring APIs prior to signing up, but it has much lower rate limits, so youâ€™re encouraged to signup for your own API key if you plan to use the API (signup is quick and easy). The rate limits for the DEMO_KEY are:

* Hourly Limit: 30 requests per IP address per hour
* Daily Limit: 50 requests per IP address per day
